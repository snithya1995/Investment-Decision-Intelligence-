**Executive Summary**
  - The Investment Decision Intelligence Platform is a data-driven system designed to evaluate publicly traded companies using
    historical financial data,risk-adjusted performance metrics, and machine learning-based forecasting.
  - The platform integrates long-term stock performance analysis, financial health evaluation, and
    predictive modeling into a decision-support framework that generates structured investment recommendations.

**Background**
  - Investors typically rely on financial tools such as stock charting platforms, news websites, and spreadsheets to evaluate      companies. While these tools provide raw financial data, they lack structured integration of growth metrics, risk              analytics, and forward-looking predictive modeling.
  - There is a need for a unified analytical system that consolidates historical data, financial fundamentals, and machine         learning forecasts into a single decision intelligence platform.
    
**Problem Statement** 

Retail investors and data-driven analysts face the following challenges:
     - Lack of structured 10-year performance evaluation
     - No standardized risk-adjusted performance metrics
     - Absence of ML-based forward-looking insights
     - Subjective decision-making
     - Fragmented data sources
This project aims to solve these challenges by building a structured investment decision system that integrates growth analysis, risk assessment, and predictive modeling into a single analytical framework.
